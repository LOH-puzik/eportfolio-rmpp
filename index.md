Research Methods and Professional Practice Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio for the **Research Methods and Professional Practice** module, part of my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence.

This site documents my learning journey, culminating in a detailed reflective piece that connects academic theory to my professional practice as a Data Scientist.

Site Structure

This portfolio is organized into two main sections, which you can explore using the navigation menu:

1.  **Reflective Piece:** This is the core of my submission. It analyzes my learning process, challenges, and key takeaways from the module, and outlines how I will apply this new knowledge in my career.
    
2.  **Appendix (Supporting Work):** This section provides detailed descriptions of the key assignments and activities completed throughout the module. It serves as the evidence base for the analysis presented in my reflective piece.
    

This portfolio was built using Jekyll and the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme.
