Collaborative Learning Discussions
==========================================================

This activity was a formative discussion focused on the **ethical, legal, and societal challenges of predictive policing**. The work demonstrates an ability to engage with a complex socio-technical issue, apply ethical frameworks, and synthesize arguments from peers into a coherent summary.

The core of the discussion involved a critical analysis of how predictive policing systems, while intended to improve efficiency, can perpetuate and even amplify societal biases. The analysis correctly identified that these systems are trained on historical crime data which is often already skewed, leading to a significant risk of creating **feedback loops**.

The summary shows an understanding of professional codes of conduct from bodies like the **ACM and BCS**, applying their principles of fairness and social responsibility to the problem. A key part of this work was the collaborative element, where insights from peers were integrated to enrich the analysis.

Overall, this piece serves as evidence of critical thinking about the social impact of AI, demonstrating the essential professional skill of moving beyond technical implementation to consider and evaluate the broader ethical consequences of technology.
