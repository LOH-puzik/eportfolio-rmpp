My Reflection on Research Methods and Professional Practice Module
==========================================================

In this reflection, I want to look back on my experience in the Research Methods and Professional Practice module. I'll talk about the work I did, what I learned from it, and how I plan to use these new skills in my job as a Data Scientist. I'll be using the reflective model from Rolfe et al. (2001) to structure my thoughts.

My work in this module started with a group discussion about the ethics of predictive policing. We looked at how these systems can be biased and create unfair feedback loops. It was a good exercise in applying professional ethics and listening to different viewpoints. After that, I dove into a literature review on a topic that I see every day at work: the struggle financial institutions have with mixing new data platforms and old IT systems. My review covered the main problems, like system inertia and technical hurdles. The findings from that review led straight to my main project, which was a research proposal. I designed a proposal to study the specific challenges that public financial institutions face, since my review showed that this area wasn't well-researched. This meant coming up with a clear research question and a practical plan to create a useful strategic framework.

I found this module to be challenging and really transformative. At first, I thought 'research methods' would be very theoretical and not very practical. But as I went through the assignments, that view completely changed. Going from a general ethics discussion to building a detailed research proposal showed me that good research is a real project. It needs careful planning and critical thought, just like any other project (Dawson, 2015). The literature review was a real turning point for me. When I looked into why tech projects fail, I realized the problems are almost never just about the technology. It hit me that you can have the best AI model in the world, but it will be useless if the company culture isn't ready for it. This connects directly to what experts on change management say about human factors being the biggest hurdle (Kotter, 1995). Understanding this made me feel much better prepared for the challenges I see at my job. Building the research proposal myself was also a great experience. It felt powerful to go from just reading about a topic to creating a plan to discover something new. I started out feeling a bit unsure, but by the end, I felt confident and clear on what I was doing. It also cemented for me that ethics can't be an afterthought; it has to be part of the plan from the very beginning to make sure your work is responsible and fair (Wachter et al., 2017).

What I learned in this module is something I can use right away in my job as a Data Scientist. The problems I researched—like old systems and resistance to change—are exactly what I deal with every day. But now, instead of seeing them as just frustrating problems, I see them as challenges that I can plan for and manage. My whole approach to projects is going to change. I'll be asking more questions that go beyond the technical details, like 'Where is this data really coming from?' and 'Who needs to be on board for this to work?'. My communication style is going to change, too. I learned that data storytelling is incredibly important. It’s not enough to just show the numbers; you have to build a story around them so that people can understand what they mean and what to do next. This skill is key for any data scientist who wants to have a real impact. In the end, this module has given me a much broader view. It helped me see beyond just the code and understand the important connection between technology and business.
