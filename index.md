A Reflection on Research Methods and Professional Practice
==========================================================

This reflective piece outlines the learning journey undertaken during the Research Methods and Professional Practice module, analyzing the work completed, the impact of the learning, and how this new knowledge will be applied in my professional career, following the principles of the Rolfe et al. (2001) framework.

The module began with a collaborative discussion on the complex ethics of predictive policing. This exercise required analyzing how algorithmic bias can create feedback loops that reinforce societal discrimination. The work involved applying ethical codes from professional bodies and integrating feedback from peers to form a comprehensive view. Following this, I conducted an in-depth literature review focused on a topic highly relevant to my professional field: the challenges financial institutions face when integrating modern big data platforms with their legacy IT systems. This review identified four key themes: the inertia of legacy systems, the drivers for modernization, the technical integration challenges, and the significant organizational barriers to change. The insights from the literature review directly informed the module's main project: a research proposal presentation. This proposal was designed to address a gap identified in the literature, focusing on the unique modernization challenges of public financial institutions. It involved creating a clear research question, designing a qualitative methodology, and outlining a practical deliverable in the form of a strategic framework.

This module was a challenging and transformative experience. Initially, the concept of "research methods" felt abstract and purely academic. However, as I progressed through the structured activities, my perspective changed significantly. The journey from the broad ethical discussion to the highly specific research proposal made me realize that research is not a theoretical exercise; it is a managed process that requires both critical thinking and practical planning (Dawson, 2015). The literature review was a pivotal moment. Delving into the reasons why technology projects fail, I saw that the obstacles were rarely just technical. It became clear that even the most advanced AI model is destined to fail if the organization is not prepared for it. This strongly connects to established theories on change management, which state that transformation efforts often fail due to human factors rather than technical ones (Kotter, 1995). This realization made me feel more equipped to understand the non-technical challenges I face in my own work. The process of constructing the research proposal was empowering. It forced me to move from consuming information to creating a plan to generate new knowledge. My emotional response shifted from uncertainty to a sense of confidence and purpose. This shift also highlighted the importance of ethical considerations, not as a checklist item, but as a core component of project design, ensuring that any proposed solution is responsible and fair (Wachter et al., 2017).

The learning from this module has direct and immediate applications in my role as a Data Scientist in the financial sector. The challenges of legacy systems, data silos, and cultural resistance that I researched are the daily reality of my work environment. My perspective has fundamentally changed; I now see these issues not as frustrating roadblocks, but as predictable challenges that must be managed strategically. Moving forward, my approach to projects will be different. I will be more proactive in asking questions about the wider context: Where is the data coming from? What legacy systems does this process depend on? Who are the key stakeholders, and what are their concerns? Furthermore, my communication style will evolve. The module’s emphasis on data storytelling showed me that the value of analysis lies in its ability to be understood and acted upon. Instead of just presenting charts and statistics, I will focus on building a clear narrative around the data. This skill is essential for a data scientist to demonstrate their value and influence decisions. Ultimately, this module has equipped me with a more holistic and strategic mindset, transforming me from a purely technical specialist into a professional who understands the critical intersection of technology, business, and people.
