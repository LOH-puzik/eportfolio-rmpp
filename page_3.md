Research Proposal Presentation
==========================================================

This presentation translated the findings from the literature review into a formal and structured **research proposal**. The work demonstrates the ability to define a clear research problem, formulate precise research questions, and design a credible methodology to answer them.

The proposal outlined a **qualitative research methodology**, justifying the choice as the best way to explore the complex "why" and "how" behind the challenges.

A significant part of the proposal was dedicated to the main **project deliverable**: a **Strategic Framework for Big Data Adoption**. This was not presented as a vague concept but as a practical tool with four concrete components:

*   A Phased Adoption Model
    
*   A Risk Mitigation Matrix
    
*   A Change Management Toolkit
    
*   A set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
    

The proposal also included professional elements like a detailed 12-month **timeline**, ethical considerations, and a risk assessment, proving a thorough and practical approach to project planning.
