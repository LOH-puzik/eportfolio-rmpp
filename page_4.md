Readings and Key Takeaways
=========================================================

This section summarizes the foundational knowledge gained from core texts and formative activities.

The module's recommended readings were instrumental in providing a strong methodological backbone for the project work. Key texts on conducting research projects emphasized the importance of treating academic work with the same rigor as a professional project, which was crucial in developing a viable plan with a clear timeline and well-defined deliverables (Dawson, 2015).

Foundational texts on statistics provided an essential understanding of the business context in which data science operates (Berenson et al., 2020).

A key practical takeaway from the module's activities was the concept of **data storytelling**. The crucial insight was that the ultimate goal of data visualization is not just to present data, but to **communicate a clear and compelling narrative**, bridging the gap between technical work and business impact.
