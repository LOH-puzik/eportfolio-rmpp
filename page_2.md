Literature Review (Big Data Adoption in Finance)
==========================================================

This literature review is a substantial piece of academic work that provides the foundation for the subsequent research proposal. Its purpose was to systematically investigate the challenges that established financial institutions face when trying to integrate modern **big data platforms** with their deeply embedded **legacy IT systems**.

The review was methodologically sound, following a **systematic process** to gather sources and applying a **thematic synthesis** to organize the findings into four central themes:

1.  The Inertia of Legacy Systems
    
2.  Key Drivers for Modernization
    
3.  Technical Challenges of Integration
    
4.  Organizational and Cultural Barriers
    

Crucially, the reviewâ€™s conclusion identified a significant **gap in the existing research**: a strong focus on commercial banks, with very little literature addressing the unique context of **public financial institutions**. This finding was the direct catalyst for the research proposal that followed.
